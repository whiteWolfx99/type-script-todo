        “I needed a vacation. I needed 5 women. I needed to get the wax out of
        my ears. My car needed an oil change. I'd failed to file my damned
        income tax. One of the stems had broken off of my reading glasses. There
        were ants in my apartment. I needed to get my teeth cleaned. My shoes
        were run down at the heels. I had insomnia. My auto insurance had
        expired. I cut myself every time i shaved. I hadn't laughed in 6 years.
        I tended to worry when there was nothing to worry about. And when there
        was something to worry about, i got drunk.” ―{" "}
